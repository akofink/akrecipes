#### Bio
I am a student at NC State University in Raleigh. I double-major in Computer Science and Computer and Electrical Engineering. My interests include both high and low level programming as well as contributing to open source technology. This website is part of the process by which I like to learn: example.

I was born in Jacksonville, NC and raised in Cape Carteret, NC. I attended Croatan High School for three years and in my senior year, I attended the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem, studying saxophone under the renowned performer Taimur Sullivan.

#### Other Interests
I love taking pictures with my DSLR camera, a Nikon D3100. I have many interests including reading, sailing, good food, visual and performing art, music, coffee and chocolate. I'll search endlessly for the best places to find whatever piques my interest--when it comes to chocolatiers, I don't think you can get any better than Escazu in Raleigh, NC. I'm a fierce raconteur, sparring over topics including engineering, finance, economics, politics, and literature.

###### music
I really love all kinds of music from Brahms to Iron and Wine. Fun, Bob Marley, Jack Johnson, Chris Potter, Mumford and Sons, The Beatles, Peter Paul and Mary, Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Billy Joel, among others. As well as playing the saxophone, I'm also picking up guitar.

###### movies and tv
Modern Family, Downton Abbey, and The Walking Dead are among my current favorites. Of course, popular shows come and go quickly, so feel free to recommend something you think I might like! Some of the movies I've liked the most include Sweeney Todd, Billy Elliot, Pulp Fiction, The Grey and Inception.

###### books
For fiction, I enjoy the Harry Potter series as well as many of the classics such as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, The Scarlet Letter, To Kill a Mockingbird, etc. There are so many! One series I read in middle school that I remember quite fondly yet is not very well known is the Tales of the Otori by Lian Hearn.

As a college student, most of my reading is naturally non-fiction. Although I have to read my textbooks, there are also many books which I enjoy outside of school. Currently, I'm reading Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea by Charles Seife, a must read for anyone interested in the origin of mathematics and philosophy.
